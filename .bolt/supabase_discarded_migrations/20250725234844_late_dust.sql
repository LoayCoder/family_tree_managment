```sql
-- Step 1: Drop the existing is_admin function.
-- Use CASCADE to drop any dependent objects (like RLS policies) that might implicitly rely on its old definition.
-- This is safer than manually dropping each policy.
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.is_admin(uuid) CASCADE;

-- Step 2: Recreate the is_admin function to correctly use the updated get_user_level function.
-- This function checks if a user has 'admin' or 'family_secretary' role.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin(user_id uuid)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Check if the user's role is 'admin' or 'family_secretary'
  RETURN (get_user_level(user_id) = 'admin' OR get_user_level(user_id) = 'family_secretary');
END;
$$;

-- IMPORTANT: After running this, you might need to re-enable or re-create any RLS policies
-- that were dropped by the CASCADE. Review your RLS policies on user_profiles, news_posts,
-- events, comments, media_files, notables, pending_person_changes, pending_woman_changes,
-- and roles tables to ensure they are correctly configured.
-- The previous refactoring steps should have included recreating these policies.
-- If you encounter further RLS-related errors, you may need to re-run the RLS policy creation scripts.
